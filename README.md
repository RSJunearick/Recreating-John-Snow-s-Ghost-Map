# Recreating-John-Snow-s-Ghost-Map
This project recreates physician John Snow's mapping of cholera outbreaks in London.

In this project, I learned some use cases of Folium for making visualizations of geographic locations.

If you can't see the map in the Jupyter Notebook, trying opening the HTML file with your browser.
